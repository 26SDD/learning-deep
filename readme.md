# Deep Learning Study Guide
### Collected Resources for Machine and Deep Learning

##### Disclaimer: I am currently a student of the USF MSAN Program (Master's in Analytics) 
Some of the material is from the coursework through the program, others from outside sources.

```python
def learn_deep():
	return knowledge
```

### [Deep Learning by Coursera, Courses 1-3 notes](coursera/) 

This is still a work in progress, but its basically a written form of the Andrew Ng. Coursera course.
