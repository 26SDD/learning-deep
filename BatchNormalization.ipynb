Depending on how you have made your NN, you may not want your hidden values to be of $\\mu=0$ and $\\sigma^2 = 1$. consider if you use a sigmoid function, you may not want all your values to be in the linear portion of the sigmoid curve, but may want to take more advantage of the non-linear tails."
